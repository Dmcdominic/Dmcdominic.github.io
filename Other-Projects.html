						This site was made from scratch as a personal project, primarily to display my game portfolio to the world.
						It was also an opportunity to apply and advance the web development skills that I gained at The Game Agency.
						I utilized a wide array of tools for this project, including Bootstrap for styling, Jekyll for local testing, and GitHub Pages for hosting.
						You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/Dmcdominic/Dmcdominic.github.io" target="_blank">source code</a> on my GitHub,
						which also contains a complete list of credits in the readme file.

					<p class="card-text about_details">
						Producing electronic music has been an on-and-off hobby of mine for about 7 years.
						I work primarily with the Maschine controller and software, along with Massive for synth creation.
						Although I have lost track of the dates for many of my songs, I can say that most of them were made in my early years of high school.
						I have recently uploaded them to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dominic-calkosz/tracks" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.

					<p class="card-text about_details">
						Teknowledge is a student organization at CMU created to teach Python to middle school and high school kids, in order to spur interest for coding.
						In Fall 2017, I was on the curriculum development team designing and producing pedagogical materials such as activities and worksheets.
						In Spring 2018, I joined the mentoring team and went to the local Obama Academy twice a week to teach students directly using the very same curriculum I had helped to create.
						The Teknowledge <a href="http://teknowledge.xyz/" target="_blank">website</a> and open-source <a href="https://github.com/google/teknowledge" target="_blank">curriculum</a> are both available online.

						<a href="http://beatsaber.com/" target="_blank">Beat Saber</a> is a VR rhythm game where you slash blocks to the beat of different songs.

						I am in the process of mapping Sanctuary, a full album by Infinity Shred.
