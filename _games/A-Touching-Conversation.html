display_title: true

description: "A conversation game about touch.
    After filling out a preliminary survey, players on either side of the wall place their hands into the box.
    They will then be prompted with charades style questions based on the comfort level inferred from the survey.
    Players must attempt to communicate complex ideas using only their hands."

# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Although this was a project for Grace's course \"Intro to Contextual Practice\", she decided to collaborate with GCS by including the four of us in this game's development.
    We spent several sessions toying with different ways to evoke unique player interaction, particularly by forcing them to communicate using only their hands.
    I helped design the experience, including physical setup, the pre-game survey which determined level of intimacy, and the prompts which guided gameplay."
