description: "Backside Breakout is a prison break role-playing game.
    Gameplay is turn based with multiple turns a day before players have to move back to their cells and lose any items not properly hidden.
    The most convenient place to stash items is in one's rectum, hence the title Backside Breakout.
    The game is won by fulfilling one of three different escape routes, possibly involving bribery, disguises, or a copious amount of spoons."

# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "This was my first board game jam, and a unique opportunity for me to practice game design without getting swept up in code.
    The five of us collaborated to develop this concept, and had a blast coming up with mechanics like the crazy old man, the butt sleeve, various prison occupations, daily events, and more."
