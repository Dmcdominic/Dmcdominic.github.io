# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Cloak and Dagger was my first time leading a GCS project, and I'm immensely proud of the result.
    I was able to coordinate the team's progress, train our novice programmers on Unity and C#, and still dedicate many hours to my own coding work.
    In order to enable and streamline the in-game character selection, I created a system for applying animations to multiple color palettes.
    I also developed a generic settings configuration system so that each match could be customized with a wide variety of in-game options.
    In addition, this was my first experience with networked multiplayer, but thanks to Carter's custom relay server and client interface, programming for synchronous play was intuitive and efficient."
