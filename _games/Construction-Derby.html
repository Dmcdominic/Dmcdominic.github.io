title: Construction Derby

description: "When the world is ravaged by nuclear fallout, there is only one way to repair things... by destroying something first!
    Participate in the grand Construction Derby where you destroy your opponent's cars while simultaneously repairing and improving your own.
    Be careful, as the hosts of this competition are not privy to fair play, and many brutal traps await those who enter.
    Keep fighting and be the last one left driving!
    Achieve glory as you smash your friend's vehicles to bits and add them to your own!"

# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Construction Derby was a blast to work on.
    I spent most of the jam programming core features, including the code for how parts are ejected from the car based on collisions, and how collected parts are displayed on the car model.
    The entire team collaborated on design, so the final result included gameplay ideas from everyone."
