# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Crossed Paths was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    The assignment was to write navmesh code and develop a game with it in C++.
    I realized that with my completed navmesh implementation, I could use two agents in symmetry to create an environmental puzzle."
