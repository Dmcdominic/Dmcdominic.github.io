# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Early in the process, we spent a lot of time iterating on different designs.
    I even implemented a networked prototype of a completely different social communication game.
    But once we settled on this concept, I got to work implementing a class hierarchy for the card and event systems focused on designer accessibility.
    Decktatorship involved a lot of networking, so as the lead programmer, I undertook the effort to make it robust.
    This involved both server and client side programming.
    Ultimately, the game lacked some polish and a couple of features that we were excited about, but it was a novel and enjoyable experience."
