# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "This was my first time developing a Discord bot and it was a ton of fun.
    We experimented with all kinds of features like forcing users to switch voice channels, automatically changing roles, updating role permissions, and dynamically generating content.
    I designed and wrote much of the gameplay code.
    It ended up being a hacky but unique game."
