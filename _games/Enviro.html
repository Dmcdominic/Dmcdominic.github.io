# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Enviro was a unique project to work on because it was the culminating group project for Computer Game Programming, which meant the whole team were adept programmers.
    I was officially designated the \"architect\", responsible for code decisions, but my teammates all made invaluable programming contributions.
    I developed the grid and object class hierarchy, movement system, undo system, and many smaller systems.
    I also sourced and implemented all of the audio, designed several puzzles, and conducted much of our playtesting.
    After the course was over, I revamped all the levels (including many new ones) in order to better teach the core mechanics and explore their potential with more challenging puzzles."
