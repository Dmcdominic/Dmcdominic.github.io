# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Helter Smelter was created in 5 weeks as the final project for a CMU course called Game Design, Prototyping, and Production.
    After working with this team through 3 previous games, I felt prepared to dive headfirst into the development of our initial concept, and created a complete prototype in the first 4 days.
    With the help of feedback from our playtesters, we then worked to adjust our design and further develop the mechanics.
    Ultimately, I had minimal help on the programming side, but this allowed me to focus on constructing and applying various custom systems.
    Developing this game taught me a great deal about how best to integrate player feedback into a continuous design process."
