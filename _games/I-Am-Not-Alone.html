# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "This project was my first time working with node.js and p5.js, but I found example projects to learn from and quickly whipped up a prototype.
    Glitch made hosting super easy.
    From there, I expanded our feature set, polished player interactions, and integrated art and audio."
