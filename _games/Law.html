title: Law

description: "Law is a card game made for a standard 52-card deck in which the rules change as you play.
    Each turn, take 3 cards from the Draw <i>or</i> Discard pile, then discard 1.
    When you get a set, straight, or flush, you get a new Law, and the rules have changed!
    Collect 4 Laws to win."

# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "This was a solo project for an assignment called \"The Frontier of Freedom\" which required us to design and develop any game at all.
    I was excited about the idea of a game for a 52-card deck which played differently every time due to a large number of possible interactions.
    The assignment was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but I adapted by using Tabletop Simulator.
    I came up with the core concept quickly, then spent weeks of playtesting in order to refine the rules and make the Laws more fun."
