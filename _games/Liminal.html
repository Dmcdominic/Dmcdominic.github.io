# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "At the start of the semester, I pitched an open-ended \"Game Narratives\" project with one goal:
    To let GCS members explore game narrative writing, and to do so in a low-stress, low-commitment setting.
    I did not have a setting or theme in mind.
    I had not even decided if we would write collaboratively, and whether or not we'd use Twine.
    But the individuals who joined this project had so many incredible ideas, and it evolved into what is now Liminal.
    My writing contribution was \"The Elevator\", as well as the opening sequence.
    I also coded the interactive house."
