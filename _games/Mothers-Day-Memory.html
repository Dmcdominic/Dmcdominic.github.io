short_description: "A memory game using family photos, created as a Mother's Day gift for my mom and grandma."

description: "15 family photos are cut in half and spread out across the table.
    Each turn, you get to flip over two pieces to try to find a matching pair.
    If they are two halves of the same photo, you keep them and get to go again.
    Otherwise, it is the next player's turn.
    Complete the most photos to win!"
