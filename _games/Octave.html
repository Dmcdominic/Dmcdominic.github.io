# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "My only work on Octave, aside from playtesting and feedback, was writing and producing a song called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dominic-calkosz/planets-of-young?in=gamecreationsociety/sets/octave-vol-1\">Planets of Young</a>.
    Electronic music production has been a hobby of mine for many years, and I took this opportunity to create music as a part of something greater."
