# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Out of Body was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    The assignment was to create a 3D game using only C++.
    This was my first time using Blender, so I stuck to primitives and vertex coloring while learning the basics.
    The concept is one that I'd considered for quite a while.
    Disconnecting the player from the camera offered a set of novel interactions which I still hope to explore further one day."
