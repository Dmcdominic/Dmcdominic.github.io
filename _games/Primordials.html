# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Primordials was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    The assignment was to write our own text drawing code using the HarfBuzz and FreeType libraries.
    Once I developed the basic text drawing functionality, I decided to push the limits by manipulating text position of individual characters each frame.
    The result is a descent into chaos which requires you to make decisions quickly."
