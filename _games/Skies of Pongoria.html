# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Skies of Pongoria was my first game written entirely in C++.
    It was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    I went out of my way to experiment with the features provided by OpenGL, SDL, glm, and other libraries.
    As I designed the world, I focused more on engagement and surprises rather than total content, so as to create a shorter but richer experience."
