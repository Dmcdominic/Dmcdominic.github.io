# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Static was created for the <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/bit-bridge-halloween-jam-2020\">Bit Bridge Halloween Jam 2020</a>.
    I primarily worked on design and audio, but as the jam deadline approached, I also committed many bug fixes and minor improvements that helped to pull the game together."
