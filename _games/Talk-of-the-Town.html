# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Global Game Jam 2018 was my first game jam, and only my second Unity project, but Adrian Biagioli took me under his wing and showed me a variety of Unity's cool features and useful tricks.
    Over the course of our 48 hour jam, I was able to design and code a number of modular minigames and then integrate them into the central game loop of Talk of the Town.
    This included some of my first work with sprites and animation in Unity.
    I was also responsible for the main menu design and functionality, and for the in-game music player."
