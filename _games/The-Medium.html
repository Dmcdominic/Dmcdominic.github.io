# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "Slay the Spire is a beautiful blend of card game and rogue-like.
    When Adrian first pitched the idea to mod it, I was immediately on board.
    We quickly set forth on initial brainstorming for the narrative premise and core mechanics, which was quite exciting.
    However, I ultimately decided to focus on programming for this project.
    This was partially due to my concurrent enrollment in GDPP, but also served as a personal experiment to work on a game while distanced from its design.
    It wasn't until the last few weeks of the semester that I realized how demotivated I was in comparison to projects which I had invested design work into.
    I am mindful that there may have been other factors, such as the rapid design and prototyping of GDPP which consumed much of my passion.
    I can not draw any definite conclusions about my future as a designer vs. programmer, but this only leaves me more excited to continue exploring."
