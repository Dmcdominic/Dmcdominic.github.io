description: "This game introduces an instrument called the Pentaton, which uses blocks of different shapes and colors to play notes on a grid.
    Explore how it works in freeplay mode, or jump into a sequence of 7 levels.

# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "The Pentaton was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    The assignment was to develop a game with sound using only C++.
    I came up with this idea for a cell-based instrument which uses the pentatonic scale so that players can experiment freely without getting a garbled mess of sound.
    This also led naturally to puzzles with specific position and orientation of notes.
    Although I was unable to develop all the automaton-style mechanics I had in mind, the result was still fully customizable and fun to experiment with."
