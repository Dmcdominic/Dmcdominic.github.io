# ----- MY CONTRIBUTIONS -----
my_contributions: "memcorrupt was a solo project created in under 1 week for <a href=\"http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f20\">Computer Game Programming</a>, a CMU course taught by <a href=\"http://tchow.com\">Jim McCann</a>.
    The assignment was to implement an asset pipeline from scratch.
    It also required us to use a constrained display system called \"PPU466,\" based (approximately) on the Nintendo Entertainment System's PPU.
    With these constraints in mind, I came up with a simple twist on a memory game and got straight to work.
    My favorite feature is that by using the same sprites for the tiles and score display, your score becomes corrupted along with the board itself."
