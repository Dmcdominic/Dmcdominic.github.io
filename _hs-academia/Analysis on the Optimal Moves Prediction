abstract: "Even though there are many different game modes in Hearthstone, the main idea is still to combat between players. In
classic mode, each player will have its own preconstructed decks and choose one of them after the banning phase. In
addition, Battleground is another game mode that contains 8 players, each player will choose a hero to play with. In the
game, each round it’s a 1v1 combat between 2 players. So in general, Hearthstone is a digital card game in which 2
players compete with each other. Such tournaments measure players’ skills and are exciting for viewers, but can take
place in a variety of match formats which fans claim drastically affect the competitiveness and viewer engagement. In
battleground mode, even though each hero has its own abilities, there should be an optimal way to play each round in
order to maximize the player’s winning rate. The purpose of this paper is to build a program that can automatically help
player make the most optimal move. The idea of this comes from HsReplay, the author uses its database. Even though
the whole program is still developing and improving, it contains some basic functions for some specific heroes. This
paper provides some references for software development to help players make the optimal moves under certain fixed
conditions so that they can win the game eventually."
