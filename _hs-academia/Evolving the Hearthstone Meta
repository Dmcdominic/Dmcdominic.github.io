abstract: "Balancing an ever growing strategic game of high
complexity, such as Hearthstone is a complex task. The target of
making strategies diverse and customizable results in a delicate
intricate system. Tuning over 2000 cards to generate the desired
outcome without disrupting the existing environment becomes a
laborious challenge. In this paper, we discuss the impacts that
changes to existing cards can have on strategy in Hearthstone.
By analyzing the win rate on match-ups across different decks,
being played by different strategies, we propose to compare their
performance before and after changes are made to improve or
worsen different cards. Then, using an evolutionary algorithm,
we search for a combination of changes to the card attributes
that cause the decks to approach equal, 50% win rates. We then
expand our evolutionary algorithm to a multi-objective solution
to search for this result, while making the minimum amount of
changes, and as a consequence disruption, to the existing cards.
Lastly, we propose and evaluate metrics to serve as heuristics with
which to decide which cards to target with balance changes."
