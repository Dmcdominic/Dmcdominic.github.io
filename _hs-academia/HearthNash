abstract: "Hearthstone is a 1-vs-1 digital card game that is played competitively in a variety of formats. In a tournament, each player
preconstructs several decks and then chooses at each point in the
match what deck they will play, according to the restrictions of a
chosen match format. Such tournaments measure playersâ€™ skill and
are exciting for viewers, but can take place in a variety of match
formats which fans claim drastically affect the competitiveness and
viewer engagement. Given that different deck archetypes have
certain expected winrates against other archetypes, an optimal
strategy exists for each player that determines with what probability they should pick each action available to them. We developed
software that can solve for optimal strategies under fixed conditions and apply this process to winrate sets to generate metrics
that can be compared across formats. We then used a large dataset
collected from live Hearthstone players to generate metrics that
reflect the competitive deck ecosystem, and used these results to
draw qualitative conclusions about various match formats."
