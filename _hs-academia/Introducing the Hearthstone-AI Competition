abstract: "The Hearthstone AI framework and competition
motivates the development of artificial intelligence agents that
can play collectible card games. A special feature of those games
is the high variety of cards, which can be chosen by the players
to create their own decks. In contrast to simpler card games, the
value of many cards is determined by their possible synergies.
The vast amount of possible decks, the randomness of the game,
as well as the restricted information during the playerâ€™s turn
offer quite a hard challenge for the development of game-playing
agents. This short paper introduces the competition framework
and goes into more detail on the problems and challenges that
need to be faced during the development process."
