abstract: "Quality diversity (QD) algorithms such as MAP-Elites have emerged
as a powerful alternative to traditional single-objective optimization methods. They were initially applied to evolutionary robotics
problems such as locomotion and maze navigation, but have yet
to see widespread application. We argue that these algorithms are
perfectly suited to the rich domain of video games, which contains
many relevant problems with a multitude of successful strategies
and often also multiple dimensions along which solutions can vary.</p><p>
This paper introduces a novel modification of the MAP-Elites
algorithm called MAP-Elites with Sliding Boundaries (MESB) and
applies it to the design and rebalancing of Hearthstone, a popular
collectible card game chosen for its number of multidimensional
behavior features relevant to particular styles of play. To avoid
overpopulating cells with conflated behaviors, MESB slides the
boundaries of cells based on the distribution of evolved individuals.
Experiments in this paper demonstrate the performance of MESB
in Hearthstone. Results suggest MESB finds diverse ways of playing
the game well along the selected behavioral dimensions. Further
analysis of the evolved strategies reveals common patterns that
recur across behavioral dimensions and explores how MESB can
help rebalance the game."
