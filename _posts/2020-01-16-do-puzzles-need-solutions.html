title: Do Puzzles Need Solutions?
---

<p>I initially thought that agreeing upon definitions for "puzzle" and "solution" would be a helpful way to begin, and lead us in a constructive direction. But it turns out that there are a variety of quite reasonable definitions for both, and by picking any pair of such definitions, we come upon a simple answer based on semantics alone. So it seems that in order to explore the capabilities and limitations of puzzles, we must rely on our intuitions. Nonetheless, one could make the argument that a puzzle, by nature (similarly <i>by definition</i>), always has a solution. Without a solution, a puzzle is simply a toy. And perhaps that is correct. But at least for a few minutes, let's take the idea of a puzzle, remove all solutions, and explore whatever the result is. So let's rephrase our question.
</p>

<p><b>"What happens when a puzzle doesn't have a solution?"</b>
</p>

<p>Specifically, I'd like to consider puzzles <i>within games</i>. Stand-alone puzzles such as a Sudoku, or a brainteaser, or a jigsaw puzzle, open up a whole can of worms and steer away from what I am trying to explore. Whether or not each of those examples could be considered a game in and of itself is up for debate as far as I'm concerned, but here we will explore games larger than a single puzzle. For instance, a "puzzle game". So perhaps we should rephrase again.
</p>

<p><b>"What happens when a game includes puzzles without solutions?"</b>
</p>

<p>Once phrased this way, it seems that we should find the answer by actually developing and playtesting a game which puts it to the test. So why discuss it at all? Well, there are many possible designs for such a game, and I believe we could reach some meaningful insights regarding those designs a priori. Now, our question has reached its final form.
</p>

<p><b>"How might we design a game that includes puzzles without solutions, and what would happen?"</b>
</p>

<p>The first design question that arises is: Should the player <i>know</i> that puzzles may or may not have solutions? This forks the space of potential games into two different directions, which lead to very different core experiences. So let's consider each one separately.
</p>

<div class="container-fluid mt-3 mb-3">
	<div class="row mb-3 justify-content-center">
		<div class="col-lg-6 col-12 right-border-lg">
			<p class="text-center"><u>The player is aware</u></p>
			<p>
			(TODO)
			</p>
		</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6 col-12">
				<p class="text-center"><u>The player is unaware</u></p>
				<p>
				(TODO)
				</p>
			</div>
	</div>
</div>

<p>So, what can we conclude?
