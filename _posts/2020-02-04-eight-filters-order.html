<p>The Eight Filters, from "The Art of Game Design" by Jesse Schell, are a set of constraints which every finished game must pass.
  They are immensely useful for evaluating your design decisions early and often.
  I would like to know what order they should be used in, but even Jesse did not have the answer.
  So it is our mission here to find out.
</p>

<p>The short answer is that order doesnâ€™t matter, because your game must ultimately pass every single one.
  Considering the filters in a different order may result in a different game, but not necessarily a better or worse one.
  Finding the right order is about the efficiency of your process.
  It should be based on how deep your changes will have to be, and whether those changes will survive the other filters until the game is done.
  The deepest issues should be addressed first.

</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Tell you the order in which to <i>sacrifice</i> less important filters. For most games, <i>they are not optional</i>!
    If it is the right decision for your game, you may choose to ignore a particular filter, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion.
  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that even if your design has passed a filter once, it will need to be considered again after changes are made.
  Thus, filters which you should consider first are also those which you should consider most frequently.
  At the same time, you should not ignore the last filter until all 7 others have been passed.
  Check regularly that all 8 filters are <i>within reach</i> of your current design trajectory, even if solving the finer issues will come later.
  In short: An ideal ordering will make your filtering process more productive by avoiding redundancy.
</p>

<p>I've found that the filters can be loosely organized into 3 groups based on how deeply you will have to redesign.
  The first group will help you form a high level idea and establish a direction that can guide you through the development process.
  These filters are relevant to the very core of your game.
  The second group will help you design smaller parts of the game, and ensure that your design is practical and implementable.
  These filters are relevant to the pieces of your game, which rely on the core.
  The third group will help you tune 
  These filters are relevant to the feel of your game, which relies on playable pieces.
</p>


<h3><u>The Core of the Game</u></h3>
<ol>
  <h4>1. Will this game sell?</h4><p>
    If your design passes every other lens, there are a limited number of factors that will prevent the game from selling. Is your intended audience too narrow? Is the market for this genre already saturated with strong competitors? Is the platform or technology for your game getting phased out?
  </p><p>These questions can be difficult to answer early in the process, but they are important to catch before tackling the other filters.
    You don't want to address the filter for intended audience before realizing that it was too narrow, or solve your technical challenges before realizing that you need to switch platforms.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Will the intended audience like this game enough?</h4><p></p>
  <h4>3. Does this game meet our social and community goals?</h4><p></p>
  <h4>4. Is this a well-designed game?</h4><p>
    As a game designer, you will develop your own instincts for good design over time.
    During the design process, you will naturally use those instincts, often without conscious effort.
    In fact, it would seem impossible to overcome the other 7 filters without applying your mental model of good design.
    But when it comes time to use that model as a filter of its own, it will be most useful when many core decisions have already been made.
  </p>
</ol>

<h3><u>The Pieces of the Game</u></h3>
<ol>
  <h4>5. Is this game novel enough?</h4><p></p>
  <h4>6. Is it technically possible to build this game?</h4><p></p>
</ol>

<h3><u>The Feel of the Game</u></h3>
<ol>
  <h4>7. Does this game feel right?</h4><p>
    Feeling out the game for yourself is a critical part of the design process, and you will likely be doing it on a daily basis.
    TODO
    When it comes
  </p>
  <h4>8. Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?</h4><p></p>
</ol>



<!-- Conclusion -->
<p>But after all this effort to find the optimal ordering, perhaps you could consider multiple filters at once.
  If you go over the list and determine which ones your game does not pass, you may be able to take two or three into account while redesigning.
  In the likely event that you're working with a team, this is especially relevant for parallelization.
  While someone is working to make the game more novel, another can conduct playtesting.
  A chosen order will help to prioritize issues, keep your process efficient, and avoid redundant design.
