    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="col-xl-5 col-lg-6 col-12 mb-5">
      <p>Magic the Gathering has been around 1993, and has reigned king of the collectible card game genre for almost as long.
        There are many things that Wizards of the Coast has done right in designing Magic, but today I want to focus on a particular factor: <b>flavor</b>.
        Jesse Schell's Elemental Tetrad for game design identifies these four core matters: Technology, Mechanics, Aesthetics, and Story.
        In a game with a mechanics focus, which <i>could</i> be played without any narrative or theme whatsoever, flavor is how story is delivered anyway.

    <!-- Introduction (cont.) -->
    <div class="col-xl-8 col-md-10 col-12 mb-3">
      <p>In Magic, as in many other tabletop games, flavor is presented in several ways.
        The most explicit is through "flavor text", special italicized text at the bottom of the card which has no mechanical effect, but offers a relevant quote or brief anecdote related to that card's story.
        Flavor is also present in card names and art.
        A card may be named "Creature 42 of Set 5" and skip the art to make room for more mechanics, but we can all agree that this wouldn't be as fun for most players.
        The one type of flavor which is most difficult to do right, but has the greatest payoff, is tying story with mechanics.
        The goal is to connect the gameplay effects of a card with the narrative of the character or event that it portrays.
        A single card may integrate all of the approaches here, constituting what some call a "flavor kit".
        When executed well, this will meld the mechanics, aesthetics, and story so tightly together that the player's understanding and appreciation of the card is effortless.
      </p>
      <p>To understand how the best cards deliver flavor, and gain insight into designing flavor in our own games, let's do a deeper dive into a few specific cards from the 2019 set themed around fairytales: "Throne of Eldraine".

  <!------- Card Analysis ------->

  <div class="row mt-4 justify-content-center">
    <!-- Trail of Crumbs -->
    <div class="col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-12 ml-2 mr-2 mb-5">
      <img class="medium-img mb-4" src="/images/GD_Blog/Taste the Cards/Trail-of-Crumbs.jpg" alt="Trail of Crumbs">

    <div class="col-xl-7 col-md-7 col-12 mb-2">
      <h3><u>Trail of Crumbs</u></h3>
      <p>The tale of Hansel and Gretel is so widely recognized that it has its own idiom referring to the trail of breadcrumbs which the two children leave.
        This card generates gameplay that parallels the well-known story.
        When you first play it, you create a Food token, like a breadcrumb.
        Thereafter, sacrificing a food token also enables you to look at the top of your deck and choose a permanent (often a creature or land) to place into your hand.
        The result is a gameplay pattern of creating Food tokens and then sacrificing them in order to find something nearby, like you are following the trail back.
        The story of Hansel and Gretel comes through beautifully, while allowing you to generate your own version of the narrative.
        Was it necessary, or worthy of such complexity, to create a special type of token just for this card?
        Perhaps... but as you will see below, the designers were more clever than that.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Food -->
    <div class="col-xl-7 col-md-7 col-12 mb-2">
      <h3><u>Food</u></h3>
      <p>This is the food token from Throne of Eldraine.
        Its effect is simple: You can consume it to restore health to yourself.
        Eating food to gain life points is so common in games that players will read the effect once and immediately understand.
        This token is not exclusive to Trail of Crumbs.
        The designers for Magic recognized that food appears frequently, and with interesting variety, in fairytales.
        By creating a single basic Food token which can be referenced by numerous cards across the set, they enabled and unified many new effects while strengthening flavor (pun intended).

    <div class="col-xl-7 col-md-7 col-12 mb-2">
      <h3><u>Oathsworn Knight</u></h3>
      <p>This card's cultural reference may not be as easily or universally recognized as the others, but it is noteworthy nonetheless.
        Oathsworn Knight is designed after The Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
        If you've seen the movie, and have a basic understanding of Magic mechanics, take a moment now to read the card's text.
        In his sword fight with King Arthur, The Black Knight's arm is cut off, but he insists "Tis but a scratch."
        He continues to fight with his other arm, until that one is cut off too.
        Assuming the battle is over, King Arther kneels to pray, when The Black Knight begins kicking and taunting him.
        This continues with his remaining two limbs, leaving him completely immobile, at which point the king says "All right, we'll call it a draw" and goes on his way.
      </p>
      <p>Oathsworn Knight starts with four limbs (+1/+1 counters), and whenever it takes damage, it loses one.
        He is headstrong and will fight if at all possible ("attacks each combat if able").
        This connection is especially strong because losing +1/+1 counters makes him deal less damage, just as The Black Knight became progressively less effective in battle as he lost limbs.

        Thanks to Jay Annelli for his article on <a href="https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/jayannelli-10012019-throne-of-eldraine-flavor-gems" target="_blank">Throne of Eldraine Flavor Gems</a>, which helped me narrow down the pool of cards with the best flavor.
        If you've made it this far, I would also recommend Mark Rosewater's GDC talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHHg99hwQGY" target="_blank">Twenty Years, Twenty Lessons Learned</a>.
        Drawing from two decades of experience designing for Magic, he details a variety of card design principles (including flavor), many of which can be extended to all kinds of other games.
