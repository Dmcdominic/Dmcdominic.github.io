		<!-- Introduction -->
		<div class="col-xl-8 col-md-10 col-12 mb-5">
			<p>I often look back on released Hearthstone mechanics in order to improve my own designs.
				There are many successes and a handful of failures that I've taken lessons from, but <b>Discover</b> stands out to me as perhaps the best-designed mechanic in Hearthstone.
				In the game, Discover reads "Choose one of three cards to add to your hand," and you can find several examples below.
			</p>
			<p>Every time I come back to it as an example to learn from, I recognize a new way in which it makes Hearthstone a better game.
				I think this is because of how <i>elegant</i> its design is.
				Jesse Schell finds that elegance can be quantified as the number of purposes that each game element serves.
				So in an effort to better understand what makes Discover such a good mechanic, I've decided to list all of the purposes that it serves in Hearthstone.

		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Deliver Theme and Flavor</u></h4>
			<p>Discover first made an appearance (and was designed especially for) the <i>League of Explorers</i>, a Hearthstone expansion in which a team of explorers set out to "Explore Azeroth's most mysterious archaeological sites and <i>discover</i> ancient treasures."
				The wording here is not a coincidence.
				The Discover mechanic parallels the story of the League of Explorers by allowing you as the player to explore and discover cards during the game.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Give Players Agency</u></h4>
			<p>Because randomness is so core to Hearthstone, players can sometimes feel cheated or unlucky.
				Discover typically uses randomness, but combats this issue by emphasizing player agency by allowing you to choose the card you take.
				To see how powerful this is, observe that deck-building is the primary avenue of agency.
				The class that you play and the cards in your deck are entirely up to you, but usually those decisions end as soon as the game begins.
				With Discover, you continue to make decisions about what cards you play with <i>during</i> the game.
				Whether they are playing to express themself or to prove their skills, reinforcing the player's feeling of agency is critical.
			</p>

		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Inspire the Player's Imagination</u></h4>
			<p>With literally thousands of cards in the game, there will often be a great variety of possible cards to Discover.
				Before a player uses their Discover card, they will think to themselves, "What could I get here?" And that's where the magic happens.
				Even before any cards are presented to them, they come up with all kinds of possible outcomes, and get excited about what they could do with those results.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Generate Stories</u></h4>
			<p>Hearthstone prides itself in creating wild, unexpected situations through interactions and random effects.
				When we can pull that off, you'll run to your friends to tell them all about the coolest, craziest thing you did in your last match...
				Discover is a perfect example of a mechanic that enables these types of player stories.
				The wide array of possibilities (see: "Inspire the Player's Imagination") combined with the feeling of agency when selecting from among your options (see: "Give Players Agency") is a recipe for exciting and personal gameplay narratives.

		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Utilize the Design Space</u></h4>
			<p>Hearthstone has a variety of core game elements:
				Cards in your hand or deck, minions on the board, the heroes themselves, your hero power...
				This is just a small subset.
				And Discover can interact with every single of these.
				Finding a new fundamental way for your players to interact with your core game elements is powerful, and can reinforce each of those elements independently.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Diversify the Design Space</u></h4>
			<p>Discover also opens up the design space for future mechanics.
				Any new keyword, theme, cycle, class... could all use Discover in a different way.
				In addition, many possibilities are opened up by Discover that couldn't have been done before.
				Thus, it is no surprise to me that <i>every expansion</i> has included Discover cards since it debuted in the League of Explorers.

		<!-- The Runespear - Expose the Hearthstone Universe - Utilize Technology & Platform -->
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Expose the Hearthstone Universe</u></h4>
			<p>Hundreds of new cards are created and released every few months, but a large percentage of them see little to no play in modes where players construct their own decks.
				Discover can bring these rarely-seen cards into the game, allowing players to see a larger variety of characters, themes, and mechanics than they would have otherwise.
				This wider exposure also gives each expansion a stronger sense of cohesion.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Utilize Technology & Platform</u></h4>
			<p>Hearthstone is an exclusively digital game in a genre defined by the physical objects that you interact with: cards.
				There are limitations that come with this choice of platform, but it also means that certain mechanics may be possible that can't be done in physical counterparts such as Magic: The Gathering.
				Discover is an excellent example of Hearthstone can utilize its digital environment.
				When 3 cards are randomly selected from a pool of hundreds, a physical cardgame would require you to have all those cards prepared in a side-deck ahead of time.
				Thus, Discover brings a new type of gameplay to this genre which could never have been created in a physical cardgame.

			<h4><u>Reward Game Knowledge</u></h4>
			<p>Competitiveness in Hearthstone is a delicate balance, because randomness will always exist to give the underdog some hope.
				Rewarding skilled players by presenting them with <i>input randomness</i> is a great way to support competitiveness.
				One way that Discover does this is by rewarding players with a better knowledge of the cards that are available in a certain Discover pool.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Reward Foresight</u></h4>
			<p>Discover also allows more skilled players to exercise their high-level strategies and game sense.
				If a player can foresee their goals several turns in advance, or predict what their opponent will do, they will choose the Discover option that is strongest in the long run.

		<!-- Discover UI/UX - Accentuate Game Feel - Employ UI/UX Solutions -->
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Accentuate Game Feel</u></h4>
			<p>Hearthstone prides itself in being juicy and maybe even tactile, if a digital game can be tactile at all.
				Objects in the gamespace are often interactable, including the board itself.
				You can click on them and get all kinds of interesting audiovisual feedback.
				Discover accentuates this by giving you a satisfying splash of coins every time you click the "hide"/"show" button.
				If nothing else, playing a Discover card just feels good.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Employ UI/UX Solutions</u></h4>
			<p>When the three Discover options are presented to you, most of the board is obstructed.
				But you almost certainly want to look at the board to decide what you should pick!
				One solution would have been to present the options in a smaller spot, out of the way.
				Hearthstone instead chose to give <i>you</i> the power of showing or hiding the cards.
				You get to see them big and up front while you're reading and considering your options, but can tuck them away when you want to focus on the board.

			<h3><u>Closing Thoughts</u></h3>
			<p>If you've played Hearthstone at all yourself, I hope that you now have a greater appreciation for the elegance of Discover's design.
				If not, I hope I didn't lose you along the way.
				I found 12 different purposes that Discover serves in Hearthstone...
				But I would not be surprised if I return to this piece one day to add more.
