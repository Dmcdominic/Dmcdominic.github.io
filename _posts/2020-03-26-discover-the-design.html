		<div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-12 mb-5">
			<p>I often look back on released Hearthstone mechanics in order to improve my own designs.
				There are many successes and a handful of failures that I've taken lessons from, but <b>Discover</b> stands out to me as perhaps the best-designed mechanic in Hearthstone.
				In the game, Discover reads "Choose one of three cards to add to your hand," and you can find several examples below.
			</p>
			<p>Every time I return to it as a prime example, I recognize a new way in which it makes Hearthstone a better game.
				Jesse Schell finds that elegance can be quantified as the number of purposes that each game element serves.
				Thus, in an effort to best understand what makes Discover such a good mechanic, I've decided to finally list all of the purposes that it serves.

			<h4><u>Deliver Theme and Flavor</u></h4>
			<p>Discover first made an appearance (and was designed especially for) the <i>League of Explorers</i>, a Hearthstone expansion in which a team of explorers set out to "Explore Azeroth's most mysterious archaeological sites and <i>discover</i> ancient treasures."
				The wording here is not a coincidence.
				The Discover mechanic parallels the story of the League of Explorers by allowing you as the player to explore and discover cards during the game.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Give Players Agency</u></h4>
			<p>Because randomness is so core to Hearthstone, players can sometimes feel cheated or unlucky.
				Discover typically uses randomness, but combats this issue by emphasizing player agency by allowing you to choose the card you take.
				To see how powerful this is, observe that deck-building is the primary avenue of agency.
				The class that you play and the cards in your deck are entirely up to you, but usually those decisions end as soon as the game begins.
				With Discover, you continue to make decisions about what cards you play with <i>during</i> the game.
				Whether they are playing to express themself or to prove their skills, reinforcing the player's feeling of agency is critical.

		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Inspire the Player's Imagination</u></h4>
			<p>With literally thousands of cards in the game, there will often be a great variety of possible cards to Discover.
				Before a player uses their Discover card, they will think to themselves, "What could I get here?" And that's where the magic happens.
				Even before any cards are presented to them, they come up with all kinds of possible outcomes, and get excited about what they could do with those results.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Generate Stories</u></h4>
			<p>Hearthstone prides itself in creating wild, unexpected situations through interactions and random effects.
				When we can pull that off, you'll run to your friends to tell them all about the coolest, craziest thing you did in your last match...
				Discover is a perfect example of a mechanic that enables these types of player stories.
				The wide array of possibilities (see: "Inspire the Player's Imagination") combined with the feeling of agency when selecting from among your options (see: "Give Players Agency") is a recipe for exciting and personal gameplay narratives.
