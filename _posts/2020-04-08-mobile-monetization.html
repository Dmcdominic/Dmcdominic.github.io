		<!-- Introduction -->
		<div class="col-xl-8 col-md-10 col-12 mb-5">
			<p>Last week, Jesse asked us to read <a href="https://www.projecthorseshoe.com/reports/featured/ph17r4.htm" target="_blank">Ethical Video Game Monetization</a> from The Twelfth Annual Game Design Think Tank.
				There were a variety of takeaways in this piece, which generally lined up with my intuitions about ethical monetization.
				Around the same time, I had started playing a free mobile game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.percent.royaldice&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Random Dice</a>, and was ever-mindful of its freemium model.
				So when I reached the section on "Common Monetization Methods and Ethics", I was particularly conscious of those which showed up in Random Dice.
				What I realized was that the modern approach to mobile monetization is to try <i>as many approaches as possible</i>.

	<!------- Approaches ------->

	<div class="row mt-4 justify-content-center">
		<!-- Free to Play  &  Loot Boxes -->

		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Free to Play</u></h4>
			<p>The first step, and the one which brings in enough players to generate revenue through all the other monetization methods, is to be free to play.
				Many gamers nowadays, especially on mobile, would prefer not to pay for a game if they just don't know whether or not it's fun yet.
				It is far easier to draw in a large playerbase, to sustain online matchmaking (with low queue times), and also to build communities when there is no barrier to entry.
				But most importantly, it gets as many people in front of your microntransaction buttons as possible.
				As of February 2020, Random Dice had over 500k downloads and $3m in revenue on the <a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/111/app/random-dice-pvp-defense/1462877149/overview" target="_blank">iOS store</a> alone.
				On the <a href="https://www.appbrain.com/app/random-dice%3A-pvp-defense/com.percent.royaldice" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> as of April 8th, 2020, it had over 1 million downloads.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Loot Boxes</u></h4>
			<p>Randomness is exciting and offers surprises to the player.
				Integrating that into your economy and rewards system makes spending money even more fun, but also more addicting, and can sometimes lead to disappointment.
				From the player's perspective, and from an ethics perspective, this may not be healthy or fair.
				But from a business perspective, those are generally upsides.
				You want your players to enjoy spending money, to be addicted to it, and if they're disappointed by many (but not all) outcomes, they may keep spending to get what they want.
				Random Dice has different loot boxes available for purchase directly, through in-game currency, or as a reward for certain gameplay performance.
				Players who earn lootboxes through normal gameplay but have not spent any money may become addicted to them, and choose to spend money for the first time because they want more.
			</p>
		</div>


		<!-- In-Game Currency  &  VIP Programs -->
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>In-Game Currency</u></h4>
			<p>Offering "Diamonds" (or other premium currency) instead of using microtransactions to purchase content directly is a common approach.
				Some players may choose to buy premium currency when they want more content or resources, but aren't sure yet what they will spend it on.
				Other players may known exactly what they want the Diamonds for.
				In either case, they will see the different purchasing options and may be tempted to make a larger purchase than they previously planned, because they will get more value.
				This fits into Random Dice alongside all of the other approaches quite well, because it is not tied to any particular gameplay or systems.
				In fact, any game that uses microtransactions could squeeze an extra layer of currency in without any major adjustments.
			</p>
			<h4><u>VIP Programs</u></h4>
			<p>Offering a one-time pass to be a "VIP" is also relatively common.
				If the player wants to get the most value over time, they will consider such a pass.
				This could be their first purchase, and once they have put any money into the game at all, a mental barrier has been broken down which allows them to continue spending.
				In addition, once they <i>have</i> the pass, they will want to continue to play, and play for longer sessions, so they can get the value they paid for.
				This becomes a feedback loop, because the more time a player is spending in the game, the more they care about the in-game content and will want to spend more again.

		<!-- Advertising  &  Pay to Play -->
		<div class="col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-sm-6 col-9 ml-2 mr-2 mb-3">

		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Advertising</u></h4>
			<p>The modern twist on advertising is to let the player choose when (and why) they watch an ad (if at all), and then reward them for it.
				They'll feel good about it if they want free in-game currency (or some other reward), and ignore it if they don't.
				Most importantly, it is a revenue stream that does not rely on players who will fork over cash directly.
				Random Dice allows you to watch a video to refresh your daily shop offers, or to get in-game currency.
				This means they simultaneously target players who are looking to gather more resources, and those who are looking to spend resources.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Pay to Play</u></h4>
			<p>The cooperative mode in Random Dice only allows you to play 5 times per day.
				If you want to play more, you have to pay a sum of diamonds (premium currency) to refresh your plays for that day, or you can chooose to upgrade to 10 plays per day.
				In addition, there is a separate mode called Random Arena which can only be played by spending diamonds.
				Both of these modes are used to target players who care more about playing what they want than they do about purchasing items.

		<!-- Cultivate Habit  &  Fear of Missing Out -->
		<div class="col-xl-7 col-md-8 col-sm-10 col-12 mb-2">
			<h4><u>Cultivate Habit</u></h4>
			<p>Random Dice has a daily rewards and quest system.
				Every 24 hours, your free rewards refresh, and all of your quests are replaced.
				In addition, the "Daily Special Deal" in the shop refreshes at the same time.
				For players who want to optimize their resources in the game, they will build a habit of checking in at least once per day, perhaps around the same time of day, so that they don't miss their "dailies".
				This habit can long outlive a player's enjoyment of the game, causing them to continue checking back and perceiving value in their resources long after they should have stopped playing.
			</p>
			<h4><u>Fear of Missing Out</u></h4>
			<p>When there are daily quests that will disappear the next day, some players don't want to miss every opportunity they can to get extra value, so they will spend money to be able to complete the quests.
				When there are daily deals that they can not afford with the in-game currency, they may be afraid of missing a great offer and decide to spend money to get it before it's gone.
				The same systems that cultivate habit in players also feed on players with FOMO (the fear of missing out).

		<!------- Conclusion ------->
		<div class="col-xl-8 col-md-10 col-12 mt-4 mb-2">
			<h3><u>Closing Thoughts</u></h3>
			<p>By casting their monetization net wide, Random Dice and other modern mobile games seem to be maximizing their revenue potential.
				Players who are willing to spend loads of money ("whales") are encouraged to do so, while players who will spend smaller amounts are also clearly considered.
				Players who do not want to spend any money at all are still a source of revenue through advertisements.
				Players who will stick around to play for a long time have a VIP model to get more value, while players who move fast between games can spend to get what they want fast.
				Finally, if any monetization method falls flat, whether it be due to design flaws or other issues (e.g. can't find advertisers), there are other revenue streams to rely on.
