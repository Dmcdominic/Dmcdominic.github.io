					<p class="card-text about_details">
						I am currently a senior in the School of Computer Science at CMU, while also pursuing a minor in <a href="https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/game-design/index.html" target="_blank">Game Design</a> under the IDeATe program.
						Some of my favorite classes so far have been: "Intro to Video Game Analysis", "Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science", and "Artificial Intelligence and Humanity".
					</p>
					<p class="card-text about_details">
						In Spring 2019, I took a course called "Game Design, Prototyping, and Production", which is an intense team-project based course that gives students a hands on experience with rapid prototyping, iterative design processes, and project management.
						Some of my favorite games so far were created in GDPP, including <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Nesting" target="_blank">Nesting</a>, <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Beatsketball" target="_blank">Beatsketball</a>, and <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Helter-Smelter" target="_blank">Helter Smelter</a>.

					<p class="card-text about_details">
						During the summers of 2019 and 2020, I interned at Blizzard Entertainment on the initial design team for <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Hearthstone</a>.
						This included designing and implementing <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/ashes-of-outland/" target="_blank">Ashes of Outland</a> and <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/scholomance-academy/" target="_blank">Scholomance Academy</a>!
						Every week on initial design is different.
						Our work spanned all facets of card design, including mechanics, theme, flavor, art descriptions, voice lines, and playtesting.
						I used a variety of tools, including Unity, internal software such as HearthEdit for implementation, Inspector for issue tracking, and many more.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text about_details">
						Initial design is the very first step in a long process that each new expansion undergoes.
						Since I couldn't show any of the content that I helped to develop until months later, I also designed a <a href="/Hearthstone-Blizztern-Set">Blizztern card set</a>.

						Cassie Eng is a Ph.D. student at in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at CMU.
						I am an RA in the Cognitive Development Lab, helping Cassie to research executive function development in pre-kindergarden children.
						Her hypothesis is that by pairing physical activity with cognitive engagement, we can improve children's performance on cognitive tasks.
						Last year, our work was focused on developing gamified versions of these tasks in the Unity game engine.
						This semester, we are using those tasks to run experiments with kids at the CMU Children's School and collect research data.
						You can find out more about Cassie and my research with her on her <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cassonde/" target="_blank">website</a>.
