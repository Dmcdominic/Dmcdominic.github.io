							Cassie Eng is a Ph.D. student at in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at CMU.
							I am an RA in the Cognitive Development Lab, helping Cassie to research executive function development in pre-kindergarden children.
							Her hypothesis is that by pairing physical activity with cognitive engagement, we can improve children's performance on cognitive tasks.
							Last year, our work was focused on developing gamified versions of these tasks in the Unity game engine.
							This semester, we are using those tasks to run experiments with kids at the CMU Children's School and collect research data.
							You can find out more about Cassie and my research with her on her <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cassonde/" target="_blank">website</a>.
