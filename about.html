					<p class="card-text about_details">
						As of January 2021, I am a full-time game designer on the <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Hearthstone</a> team at Blizzard Entertainment!
					</p>
					<p class="card-text about_details">
						During the summers of 2019 and 2020, I interned on the initial design team for Hearthstone.
						This included designing and implementing <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/ashes-of-outland/" target="_blank">Ashes of Outland</a> and <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/scholomance-academy/" target="_blank">Scholomance Academy</a>!
						Every week on initial design was different.
						Our work spanned all facets of card design, including mechanics, theme, flavor, art descriptions, voice lines, and playtesting.
						I used a variety of tools such as Unity, Jira, HearthEdit (internal scripting software), and more.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text about_details">
						Initial design is the very first step in a long process that each new expansion undergoes.
						Since I couldn't show any of the content that I helped to develop until months later, I designed a <a href="/Hearthstone-Blizztern-Set">2019 Blizztern card set</a>.
						Also check out my <a href="/Blizztern-Expo-2020">2020 Blizztern Virtual Expo Board</a>!

						In December 2020, I graduated from the School of Computer Science at CMU with a minor in <a href="https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/game-design/index.html" target="_blank">Game Design</a> through the IDeATe program.
						Some of my favorite classes were: "Computer Game Programming", "Intro to Video Game Analysis", and "Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science".

					<p class="card-text about_details">
						In Spring 2019, I took a course called "Game Design, Prototyping, and Production", which is an intense team-project based course that gives students a hands on experience with rapid prototyping, iterative design processes, and project management.
						Some of my favorite games so far were created in GDPP, including <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Nesting" target="_blank">Nesting</a>, <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Beatsketball" target="_blank">Beatsketball</a>, and <a href="https://Dominic-Calkosz.com/games/Helter-Smelter" target="_blank">Helter Smelter</a>.

						The Game Creation Society is a student organization at CMU dedicated to developing video games.
						Every semester, the club divides into interdisciplinary teams, each setting out to complete a game from scratch in under 3 months.
						Many of my titles so far, including <a href="/games/Binary-Star">Binary Star</a> and <a href="/games/Cloak-and-Dagger">Cloak and Dagger</a>, are products of GCS.

					<p class="card-text about_details">
						In 2020 I was President of the Game Creation Society. This involved various responsibilities, such as leading events, managing the other officers, and communicating with industry partners.
						It also involved transitioning the club to a remote settings as we adapted to the circumstances of COVID-19.

						<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cassonde/" target="_blank">Cassie Eng</a> is a Ph.D. Candidate in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at CMU.
						For over 3 years, I was an RA in the Cognitive Development Lab helping Cassie research executive function development in pre-kindergarten children.
						Her hypothesis is that by pairing physical activity with cognitive engagement, we can improve children's performance on cognitive tasks.
						In 2017 & 2018, our work was focused on developing gamified versions of these tasks in Unity.
						In 2019 & 2020, we used those tasks to run experiments with kids at the CMU Children's School and collect research data.
