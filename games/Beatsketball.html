			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				Beatsketball was my first time developing a rhythm game, but I went into it knowing that a robust musical timing interface would make the core of an enjoyable and engaging game.
				With this in mind, I dedicated all my efforts during the first week to build a functional prototype that got the rhythm right, even when the game's timescale was changed during runtime.
				After receiving positive feedback on the initial demo, and on our designs for the following week, I switched gears and focused on the player experience.
				Our goal was to create gameplay that is simultaneously competitive and lighthearted. And of course, we wanted it to feel polished.
				I worked, both as a designer and programmer, to make sure that the players felt a satisfying response to each input <i>and</i> understood the outcome of every action, as effortlessly as possible.
