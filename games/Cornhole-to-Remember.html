			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
				This Father's Day gift was a mash-up of two of my dad's favorite games: <i>Cornhole</i> and <i>Times to Remember</i>.
				We started by laying out bean bags and pins to mark every year from 1970 to 2020.
				Then someone read off a major life event, and my dad would throw a bean bag as close to the corresponding year as possible.
				He then had to pick a range of years that included whichever year the bag landed on.
				If the event occured within those years, he won that range.
				My grandpa played simultaneously, with his own life events, and whoever won the most ranges was the victor.

			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				My mom and I worked together on this as a Father's Day gift for both my dad and my grandpa.
				I designed the game, then she helped me pick out events in their lifetimes to use for each question.
