			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				Helter Smelter was created in 5 weeks as the final project for a CMU course called Game Design, Prototyping, and Production.
				After working with this team through 3 previous games, I felt prepared to dive headfirst into the development of our initial concept, and created a complete prototype in the first 4 days.
				With the help of feedback from our playtesters, we then worked to adjust our design and further develop the mechanics.
				Ultimately, I had minimal help on the programming side, but this allowed me to focus on constructing and applying various custom systems.
				Developing this game taught me a great deal about how best to integrate player feedback into a continuous design process.
