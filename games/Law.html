			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
				Law is a card game made for a standard 52-card deck in which the rules change as you play.
				Each turn, take 3 cards from the Draw <i>or</i> Discard pile, then discard 1.
				When you get a set, straight, or flush, you get a new Law, and the rules have changed!
				Collect 4 Laws to win.

			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				This was a solo project for an assignment titled "The Frontier of Freedom" which required us to design and develop any game at all.
				I was excited about the idea of a game for a 52-card deck which played differently every time due to a large number of possible interactions.
				I came up with the core concept quickly, then spent weeks of playtesting in order to refine the rules and make the Laws more fun.
