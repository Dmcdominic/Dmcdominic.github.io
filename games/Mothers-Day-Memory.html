			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
				15 family photos are cut in half and spread out across the table.
				Each turn, you get to flip over two pieces to try to find a matching pair.
				If they are two halves of the same photo, you keep them and get to go again.
				Otherwise, it is the next player's turn.
				Complete the most photos to win!

				My sister and I worked together on this as a Mother's Day gift for my mom and grandma.
				I designed the game, then she selected and prepared the photos.
