			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				Slay the Spire is a beautiful blend of card game and rogue-like.
				When Adrian first pitched the idea to mod it, I was immediately on board.
				We quickly set forth on initial brainstorming for the narrative premise and core mechanics, which was quite exciting.
				However, I ultimately decided to focus on programming for this project.
				This was partially due to my concurrent enrollment in GDPP, but also served as a personal experiment to work on a game while distanced from its design.
				It wasn't until the last few weeks of the semester that I realized how demotivated I was in comparison to projects which I had invested design work into.
				I am mindful that there may have been other factors, such as the rapid design and prototyping of GDPP which consumed much of my passion.
				I can not draw any definite conclusions about my future as a designer vs. programmer, but this only leaves me more excited to continue exploring.
