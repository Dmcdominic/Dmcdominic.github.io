			<h4>My Contributions</h4>
			<p>
				Verto Animo was my first GCS project, and my introduction to Unity.
				Luckily, my team lead Carter was a willing mentor, and we have since become great friends.
				My focus during this project was on building game mechanics such as moving platforms and walls, buttons to trigger those movements, and checkpoints to ease intra-level progression.
				In addition, I took the opportunity to delve into Unity's canvas system by creating all of our menus and UI.
				Finally, I wrote a persistent data saving structure in order to track the players' level progress.
